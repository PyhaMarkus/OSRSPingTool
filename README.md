# OSRSPingTool
A tool for pinging Old School Runescape game servers.

User types the server's number in an inputbox and the tool displays the ping results in an Output box.
Also allows users to choose how many packets are being sent and received. 

* Potential soon to come updates: *
- A button for pinging all of the game worlds at once.
